## Hey there!ðŸ‘‹
> I'm an aspiring **cybersecurity engineer** currently working toward my **[Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT)](https://tcm-sec.com)** certification from TCM Security, Inc. Iâ€™m passionate about cybersecurity and love exploring real-world offensive techniques and researching new exploits. On the side, I enjoy building things with **Vue.js** â€” itâ€™s my go-to for web development. Whether itâ€™s breaking into systems (ethically!) or building intuitive user interfaces, Iâ€™m all about learning, building, and growing.
