## 👋 Hey there!
I'm an aspiring **cybersecurity engineer** currently working toward my **[Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT)](https://tcm-sec.com)** certification from TCM Security, Inc. I’m passionate about cybersecurity and love exploring real-world offensive techniques and researching new exploits. On the side, I enjoy building things with **Vue.js** — it’s my go-to for web development. Whether it’s breaking into systems (ethically!) or building intuitive user interfaces, I’m all about learning, building, and growing.

## 🚧 Current Project

Check out my current project: [**WebPaddock**](https://github.com/vsalc/web-paddock).

**WebPaddock** is a Vue.js web application that transforms raw Formula 1 data into interactive, beginner-friendly visualizations. It tracks real-time or historical changes in driver positions lap-by-lap, highlights pit stop strategies, and includes weather conditions when available. The goal is to make the strategic depth of racing more accessible to newcomers — because it’s definitely not who has the fastest car.
